 <h2>Connor. Kenway</h2>
 <p>Ratonhnhaké:ton (/radũnhaɡɛ̌ːdõ/, born 1756), also known by the adopted name of Connor, was a Kanien'kehá:ka-born Master Assassin of the Colonial Brotherhood during the period of the American Revolutionary War. He is an ancestor of Desmond Miles through the paternal line.[2]

    Born to the British Templar Haytham Kenway and Kaniehtí:io, a Kanien'kehá:ka woman from the village of Kanatahséton, Ratonhnhaké:ton was raised in Kanatahséton. In 1760, while he was still a young child, he was assaulted by Charles Lee and other Colonial Templars seeking the First Civilization temple which the Kanien'kehá:ka were protecting and lost his mother shortly thereafter when it was burned down by either the Templars or the forces of George Washington as his father later alleged.
    
    Concerned by the outside world's impact on his people, Ratonhnhaké:ton eventually joined the Assassin Brotherhood under the advice of Oiá:ner in order to protect his village and prevent the Templars from returning. Finding the Templars had wiped out the Colonial Assassins years prior, Ratonhnhaké:ton convinced the Assassin Mentor Achilles Davenport to train him and adopted the more Western-sounding pseudonym of 'Connor'.
    
    During his hunt for the Templars, Ratonhnhaké:ton aided the Patriot movement and protected George Washington, unwittingly becoming an important figure of the American Revolution. However, he was conflicted by wanting to reconcile with his father, despite Achilles' warnings as to the futility of uniting the Assassin and Templar philosophies, and his dogged pursuit of Charles Lee, whom Haytham staunchly supported.
    
    Upon learning that it was Washington, not Lee, who had burned his village, Ratonhnhaké:ton became disillusioned with the Revolutionaries but continued using them to aid in the eradication of the Templars. He reluctantly accepted Washington's request for help investigating Benedict Arnold and then in disposing of an Apple of Eden he had recovered. The latter incident saw Ratonhnhaké:ton trapped in an alternate reality constructed by the Apple, one wherein Washington ruled as king through tyranny. Eventually, Ratonhnhaké:ton escaped this reality and disposed of the Apple.
    
    Following Achilles' death, Ratonhnhaké:ton went on to rebuild and lead the Colonial Assassins in the newly formed United States of America. In this capacity, he expanded the Assassin network in the New World and reconnected a number of previously detached Brotherhoods across the region.</p>

 <h2>Haytham E. Kenway</h2>
 <p>Born in 1725 in London to former pirate-turned-Master Assassin Edward Kenway and his second wife Tessa, Haytham belonged to the British nobility and was raised secluded from other children, being trained to be an Assassin from an early age. However, this changed in 1735, when Edward was murdered by unknown assailants who broke into their home one night. Haytham's half-sister, Jennifer, was kidnapped in the confusion, while Haytham was forced to kill for the first time in order to save his mother.[6] Edward's acquaintance Reginald Birch, unknown to him a Templar and the one responsible for the attack, was appointed Haytham's legal guardian and took him on an unsuccessful quest throughout Europe to find Jennifer, during which Haytham was trained in the ways of the Templars, eventually joining the order in 1744.[7]

    In 1754, he was tasked by Birch to travel to the Thirteen Colonies after retrieving a "Piece of Eden", a powerful artifact made by the lost Precursor race, from the Assassins, to find the Precursor temple it was thought to open, as well as establishing a presence for the Order on the continent as the new Grand Master of the Colonial Rite of the Templar Order.[8] Recruiting Charles Lee, William Johnson, Thomas Hickey, Benjamin Church, and John Pitcairn, Haytham was successful in establishing a base for the Order on the continent after killing his former associate Edward Braddock. However, his quest to find the temple his Piece of Eden was supposed to open proved unsuccessful.[9] During this time, he had a brief relationship with a Native American woman, Kaniehtí꞉io (or "Ziio"), which resulted in the latter remaining pregnant with their son, Ratonhnaké:ton. Haytham left Ziio to focus on his Templar affairs before their son was born, and did not learn about his existence until much later in life.[10]
    
    Haytham returned to Europe in 1757 to continue searching for Jennifer, which eventually led him to the Ottoman Empire, where he recovered her from slavers.[11] After she revealed to him that Birch was behind their family's demise, he led an attack on his estate, where Birch was killed, and Haytham was gravely injured.[12]
    
    After recovering from his injuries, he returned to the colonies, where he extended the Templar's influence. From 1758 to 1760, he worked with former Assassin-turned-Templar Shay Patrick Cormac to keep the Assassins from accessing Precursor sites that could lead to devastating earthquakes, eventually taking out his father's former first mate and fellow Assassin Adéwalé in the wake of the Siege of Louisburg.[13] As the Assassins refused to give up hunting for the Precursor sites, Haytham and Shay eventually clashed with the remaining Assassins in a Precursor site in the Arctic, where the Colonial Brotherhood of Assassins was defeated and their leader, Achilles Davenport, crippled by Haytham.[14]
    
    After destroying the Assassins and making the Templars the dominant force on the continent, Haytham's main goal over the next two decades was to replace British colonial rule and establish a new state where the Templars' ideals would become law. However, his attempts were thwarted by his son, now known as Connor, who was trained as an Assassin by Achilles to take vengeance on the Templars, whom Connor blamed for an attack on his village which killed his mother.[10] His fellow Templars had chosen not to tell Haytham of the attack, knowing the news of Ziio's death would affect him, but when questioned for details, they revealed that it was ordered by George Washington.[15] The news of having a son shocked Haytham, who became torn between his loyalty to the Order and his newfound sense of paternal responsibility. When Connor was later framed by the Templars for a plot to assassinate Washington, Haytham, not wanting to have his son's death on his conscience, secretly saved him from his execution.[16]
    
    In 1778, Haytham and Connor formally met and formed an unstable alliance to track down former Templar Benjamin Church and further the Revolution.[17] Realizing his son could become an important asset if converted to the Templars, Haytham took this opportunity to teach him about the Order's true goals and motives, and eventually told him the truth about Washington's attack on his tribe, hoping to turn Connor against the latter. However, this had the opposite effect, as Connor became distrustful of both Haytham and Washington and cut ties with them, yet continued supporting the Continental Army.[18]
    
    Eventually admitting he would not be able to turn his son into a Templar and realizing the threat he posed to the Order, Haytham decided to do his best to stop him from destroying what was left of the Colonial Templars. In 1781, correctly predicting that Connor would target his last remaining ally, Charles Lee, Haytham sent the latter away after giving him his Piece of Eden for safekeeping, and waited for his son's arrival at Fort George. When Connor infiltrated the fort expecting to find Lee, Haytham ambushed him, but was ultimately bested by Connor, who mortally wounded him. Before dying, Haytham mocked Connor and his Assassin ideals, saying he did not regret his actions, but admitted that he was still proud of his son's growth and that he should have killed him much earlier.[19] Sometime after Haytham's death, Connor recovered his journal, in which the former revealed that he did not expect to survive his final confrontation with Connor and that he wanted his son to have his journal, so that he would better understand his point of view and maybe forgive him, implying that Haytham let Connor kill him.</p>
